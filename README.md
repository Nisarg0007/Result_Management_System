# **Result Management System🏫**  
*A Python-based console application to manage student results efficiently, with separate portals for teachers and students.*  

---

## 📌 **About the Project**  
**Result Management System** implements CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage student results efficiently. The application uses Python with SQLite for data storage, allowing seamless interaction between the program and the database. This ensures that student records are securely stored and can be easily retrieved, modified, or deleted as needed.The system uses **SQLite** for database storage and **ReportLab** to generate professional-looking **PDF marksheets**.

Note: This project was created as a part of a college team project, showcasing collaborative software development and Python database integration skills:
